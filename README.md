Data Mining Project
==============================

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing soil fertility and COVID-19 data through data mining techniques. It includes data analysis, preprocessing, pattern extraction, classification, and clustering.

## Part 1: Data Analysis and Preprocessing
- Analyze static soil fertility data (Dataset 1).
- Preprocess data to handle missing values, outliers, and normalize attributes.
- Analyze temporal COVID-19 data (Dataset 2).
- Visualize COVID-19 trends over time and by zone.

## Part 2: Pattern Extraction, Association Rules, and Correlations
- Discretize climate attribute data.
- Extract frequent patterns and association rules using Apriori algorithm.
- Identify strong association rules using correlation measures.

## Part 3: Supervised and Unsupervised Analysis
- Implement classification algorithms (KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to predict soil fertility levels.
- Implement clustering algorithms (k-means, DBSCAN) to identify soil property clusters.
- Compare and evaluate classification and clustering results.
